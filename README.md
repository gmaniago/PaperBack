# PaperBack

## Description
  **PaperBack** is an application that lets booklovers from all over rent a book of their choosing. A Netflix for for books.

Taking inspiration from my appreciation for books and Netflix, I decided to combine the two. Readers will be able to rent a book or view the material online. There are several reasons why such an app would be helpful to those who love to read, either for leasure or need.  Books can be expensive, for a small monthly fee readers can enjoy a book for as long as they want and be able to return the book when they are ready for another one. EBooks can be read at home or on the go with the use of mobile phones and tablets. Readers can choose from a variety of books not readily available to them.

The user will be able to register for a new account and after be taken to a menu list of books sorted by genre or popularity. After choosing they will be able to choose between reading the book online or having the book directly sent to them through snail mail and repeat the process once the book has been read.
  I hope to accomplish this part of the project and if given time, I would like to intergrate a rating system for books.
