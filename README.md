# PaperBack

## Description
  **PaperBack** is an application that lets booklovers from all over organize and search books.

Taking inspiration from my appreciation for books. I would like to build an app that will help me search and organize the books that I would like to read and save them.

Users will be able to register and log in. Books will be shown for them to be able to choose a book or a search bar can also be used.
